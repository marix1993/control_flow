### Take 10 integers from the user and print
### their average value once you have them all

# print("Hi, today I'm going to provide you the average number of your inputs.\n"
#       "Could you give me your numbers?")
# number1 = int(input())
# number2 = int(input())
# number3 = int(input())
# number4 = int(input())
# number5 = int(input())
# number6 = int(input())
# number7 = int(input())
# number8 = int(input())
# number9 = int(input())
# number10 = int(input())
#
# numbers_list = [number1, number2, number3, number4, number5, number6, number7, number8, number9, number10]
#
# print(numbers_list)
#
# average_from_numbers = sum(numbers_list) / len(numbers_list)
# print(f"Your average is: {average_from_numbers}")

### Write a while loop to print the following series:10, 20 ,30, 40 etc. up to 300

# number = 10
#
# while number <= 300:
#     print(number)
#     number += 10
